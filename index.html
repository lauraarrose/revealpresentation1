					<h1>Concept</h1>
						<p>Surreal game of Tinder in which a player swipes a moving image of a face left to reject and right to accept, and then must watch the consequences of their decision
						</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What Happens When you Swipe</h2>
						<p></p>
						<h3>Left</h3>
							<p>Video changes and the face begins to dissolve into nothing while also looking disappointed and upset, subtly. Maybe the color in the room will change - darker and cooler - and maybe there will be some sound.
							</p>
						<h3>Right</h3>
							<p>Video changes and the face begins to glow and possibly expand while also looking satisfied and proud, subtly. Maybe the color of the room will change - brighter and warmer - and maybe there will be some sound.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Who Am I Filming?</h2>
						<p>The people must be diverse in age and appearance, and with neutral expressions to begin with - blinking at you curiously. 
						</p>

				<section>
						<p>I will need a large sample of people so that swiping can be repeated and the player won't get the same face twice.
						</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h1>AND THEN WHAT?</h1>
					<p>The objective is to force people to look at each other and see each other as human beings before and after they dismiss them/make snap judgments.
					</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<p>If it's done well I'm hoping people will feel very uncomfortable and MAYBE EVEN CRY. 
					</p>
					<iframe src="http://giphy.com/gifs/P1z5gwECYPRnO/html5" width="480" height="195" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
					<p>And maybe laugh. Part of me wants some of the faces to do funny things (or if not funny, exaggerated - like get angry). Most of me wants the reactions to be very subtle. 
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h2>Problems I'm Expecting and WORRIED About</h2>
					<p>How to get my faces to express genuine emotion! 
					</p>
					<p>I've never really filmed anyone before - how do I make sure everyone is in the same spot and not moving around but also STAYING GENUINE (Requiring MULTITASKING from the participants worries me a little).
					</p>
					<p>Manipulating the videos with code or with some other program first? Do I have time to do this well if I currently know very little about most things???
					</p>

				<section>
				<h1>Other Things I'm Thinking About</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
				<p>Can I use SPACE more - create some sort of environment - without taking away from the idea?</p>
				<p>Maybe use sound and color?
				</p>
				<iframe src="http://giphy.com/gifs/13hlybOsneaRuU/html5" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
				</section>
				<section>
				<p>My first idea was to include holograms - have a face projected in front of the screen so you end up swiping through the foggy ghost face.</p>
				<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Mwfsy_R_dY/maxresdefault.jpg"/>
				</section>
				<section>
				<p> I like that this could make for a creepier experience...and sort of goes back to the online dating thing with ghosting. 
				</p>
				<p>But that's cheesy. 
				</p> 
				</section>
				<section>
				<p>How many screens do I really need? How many players should be playing at once? </p><p>Would it work with one player but on a larger scale? Or is it more difficult to connect to a giant face vs a normal size face?</p>
